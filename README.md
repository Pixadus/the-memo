# the-memo
A Discord bot designed to collect news from a variety of sources.

These sources could be periodic web scraping, RSS feeds, or possibly APIs available from individual news companies. Links would be thrown into their representative categories according to keywords present in the title, for instance:

*"**US** **Tech** Students Create Incredibly Awesome Discord News Bot"*. 

This headline would be thrown in both US News and Tech news. 

## To-Do:
- [X] Initialize project, choose language
- [ ] Define sources (RSS feeds, newsapi.org, etc)
- [ ] Create system to pull from these sources (bs4, lxml)
- [ ] Implement source-to-text-channel
